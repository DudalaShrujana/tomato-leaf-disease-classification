🍅 Tomato Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project detects diseases in tomato plant leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
It uses a Kaggle dataset and provides a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
The application can also be deployed using Docker for easy sharing and demonstration.

Observations:

Steady increase in accuracy shows effective learning.

Validation accuracy closely tracks training accuracy → good generalization.

Minor fluctuations in validation loss are expected due to dataset diversity.

CPU-only training caused longer epoch durations (~30–40 min per epoch).

Limitations:

Accuracy can improve with transfer learning (MobileNetV2, ResNet50) and GPU acceleration.

Model is trained on a fixed dataset, may need retraining for real-world scenarios.
